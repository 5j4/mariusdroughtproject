          <p>The <abbr title="Managing the Risks, Impacts and Uncertainties of drought and water Scarcity">MaRIUS</abbr> research consortium incorporate expertise across the range of drought impacts from environmental, social, humanities, economics and engineering perspectives. Moreover, the consortium has a track record of innovation in the development of interdisciplinary science and stakeholder engagement. The consortium partners (Oxford, Bristol and Cranfield Universities, the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology and the Met Office) have worked together in a variety of collaborations, and are motivated by the prospect of developing an interdisciplinary and integrative approach to drought impacts analysis and risk management, which we consider to be very timely, both scientifically and in practice.</p>

Currently, Dr. Byers' research at IIASA is on water and climate change risks to the energy sector using global hydrological models and energy sector downscaling tools. His previous work has covered a variety of angles, from water footprinting of electricity pathways and different cooling systems, to catchment hydrology and simulation of water withdrawal licensing regimes. He will work on investigating the impacts of drought on the electricity sector in the UK. This includes development of a module for characterising future water demands of the electricity sector, and development of simulation rules to implement different abstraction licensing regimes.</div>

					<div class="profile">Dr Cedric Laize is a hydro-ecological modeller at the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology in Wallingford. His current interests include hydrological and/or spatial information relevant to ecological studies; large-scale climate-flow-ecology association; and hydraulic geometry. He works on the topics of flow regimes, physical habitat and ecological response; and the ecological Consequences of Floods. Cedric’s work on MaRIUS will be to undertake an assessment of the effect of droughts on ecology, by combining hydrological alteration metrics and using eco-hydrological models of organism/community response to long-term discharge. The output will be biologically-based eco-hydrological indicators of low flow regimes enabling assessment of implications of drought for fish, macro-invertebrates and macrophytes. This will be undertaken in association with Pam Berry and Mike Acreman.</div>

					<div class="profile">Dr Mohammad Mortazavi is a post-doctoral researcher at the University of Oxford. Mohammad’s research is focused on applying optimization methods in water resources management. His main interest is to address uncertainty and deep uncertainty associated with climate change and demand growth factors in water resources planning, especially during low-flow events and droughts. Developing drought management plans and also risk-based analysis of water planning are other research interests. For MaRIUS, his work involves developing water system models for the Thames basin and on a national scale. The long-term goals are to assess vulnerability of different users to drought events either in a catchment or on a national scale. The next step is to implement multi-objective optimization to sort through all possible solutions and their combinations for drought mitigation and to present trade-offs between desired objectives.Before arriving at Oxford, he worked at Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO), Australia, as a post-doc fellow. His research aim was to use real options analysis to address planning uncertainty in the commodity sector. He also applied multi-objective optimization to address climate change uncertainty in urban water planning in a research project at university of Newcastle, Australia, granted by National Climate Change Adaptation Research Facility (NCCARF) in Australia. Mohammad earned his PhD at the University of Newcastle, Australia and his Master’s Degree at Kh.N.Toosi university of Technology in Iran. The main focus of his PhD was the application of multi-objective optimization in urban water management for long-term and staged planning.</div>
