Management of water resources, droughts and water scarcity in the UK is undergoing significant changes. Our vision is that management of droughts and water scarcity will in future be more explicitly risk based, incorporating analysis of the full range of drought impacts for people and the environment, and a systemic understanding of their interactions and uncertainties. 
In achieving this vision, the <abbr title="Managing the Risks, Impacts and Uncertainties of drought and water Scarcity">MaRIUS</abbr> project has developed an integrated suite of models of drought processes and impacts. The following dashboards provide a common platform for the synthesis, communication and interactive exploration of the <abbr title="Managing the Risks, Impacts and Uncertainties of drought and water Scarcity">MaRIUS</abbr> models, outputs, and key findings.

		The  <a href="{{ site.dpe_url }}/"> <b>Droughts, People and the Environment Dashboard</b></a>  provides an interactive summary of the key <abbr title="Managing the Risks, Impacts and Uncertainties of drought and water Scarcity">MaRIUS</abbr> outputs on droughts, their various impacts, and ways in which they can be managed, for a variety of users. Explore the interactive pages to learn more.
