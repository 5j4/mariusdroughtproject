Drought management is a problem of minimising negative impacts, given uncertain information about past, present and future conditions. This is dependent on how impacts and risks of droughts and water scarcity are understood, managed by key stakeholders, and shaped by institutions, regulation and markets.

Droughts occur at multiple spatial scales and evolve over timescales that make them distinctive compared to other ‘natural’ hazards. The impacts of water scarcity on the environment, society and the economy are complex, reflecting meteorological and hydrological conditions as well as human choices and trade-offs between competing claims for water. At a broad scale drought plans, drought orders and permits, as well as more general powers for environmental regulators to limit the abstraction of water from ground and surface water bodies are key regulatory tools for preventing and managing drought.

The range of drought management options will also depend on the economic, environmental, and societal context, and specific drought impacts being managed. A range of management options have been modelled as part of MaRIUS. For example, different water resource management strategies related to the abstraction, allocation, and transfer of water [link to water use and scarcity page]; water resource management strategies related to water demand and abstraction and effects on hydrology [link to hydrological response page], water quality, ecology, and the economy [link to water quality, ecology, economy impacts pages]; effects of irrigation management strategies on agriculture [link to agriculture impacts pages]; and investment in hydraulic capital [link to economy impacts pages].

The interactive MaRIUS Integrated Drought Impact and Management dashboard allows visualisation of alternative metrics and indicators of the performance of management options.
