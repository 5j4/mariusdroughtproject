Droughts and water scarcity jointly pose a substantial threat to the environment, agriculture, infrastructure, society and culture in the UK, yet our ability to characterise and predict their occurrence, duration and intensity, as well as minimise their impacts, is often inadequate.

In MaRIUS we developed new methodologies and models for analysis of the impacts of water scarcity on ecosystems, society and various economic activities including agriculture, industry and household consumers. By supporting the analysis of a full range of impacts in a common framework MaRIUS provides multi-attribute characterisation of drought impacts and evidence to evaluate trade-offs between different impacts.

Water is fundamental for the functioning of all ecosystems, but they may display different responses depending on their ecological characteristics and the severity and duration of water shortages. In MaRIUS ecological models were refined and combined for improved assessment of the impacts of drought on aquatic and wetland habitats and their species. These impacts were also linked to ecosystem function and services, and potential effectiveness of ecosystem management and conservation explored.
