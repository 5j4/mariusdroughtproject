_title: Management Dashboard
---

The **management dashboard** synthesises environmental, economic and social dimensions of water scarcity. It provides a common platform for the exploration of the multiple impacts of water scarcity, the effectiveness of drought management options, and potential trade-offs at different geographical and spatial scales.

The dashboard is designed to be non-technical (with technical aspects available via the science dashboard), to enable the user to readily understand, visualise, explore, and compare likely outcomes arising from applying pre-existing drought management arrangements and/or enhanced or innovative management strategies. The pages provide key results and examples of how these could be used to support drought management.

The pages outline the different components of the MaRIUS research and are structured to provide an end-to-end overview of drought and water scarcity, impacts, and management options. The graphics are interactive to allow users to visualise different results and compare these across the pages for a selected set of drought events.
