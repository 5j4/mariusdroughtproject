_title: The <abbr title="Managing the Risks, Impacts and Uncertainties of drought and water Scarcity">MaRIUS</abbr> Project
---

Droughts and water scarcity pose a significant risk to societies, economies and ecosystems worldwide.  In 2012 the UK experienced the driest spring in over a century, following two dry winters.  A full drought could have led to potential losses of £1.5 billion.

Yet despite this severe economic impact, our scientific understanding of the complex drivers causing drought occurrence, duration and intensity, and our ability to characterise and predict their occurrence to minimise their impacts, is often inadequate.

The **MaRIUS** project explores how best to manage future droughts, introducing a risk-based approach to drought and water scarcity in order to inform management decisions and prepare households.

*Outline of the pages and explain results display e.g. outline the sub-set of droughts selected for use in results e.g. level 1 – mild, level 2 moderate, level 3, severe, level 4 – extreme drought??*

Aim: To provide a common platform for the communication and exploration of the multiple impacts of water scarcity, the effectiveness of drought management options, and potential trade-offs, for a range of stakeholders. 

*Explain the dashboard: What is its purpose and how to use, potential uses and users…*

The interdisciplinary tool aims to enable easy comparison of likely outcomes arising from applying both pre-existing drought management arrangements and enhanced/innovative management strategies…
