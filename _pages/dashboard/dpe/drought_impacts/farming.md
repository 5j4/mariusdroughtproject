Droughts and water scarcity affect rain-fed and irrigated **agricultural** systems across multiple timescales.  Effects on long term yield and profit variability influence farm business planning and investment, for example affecting crop and rotation selection and investment in infrastructure for irrigation. In <abbr title="Managing the Risks, Impacts and Uncertainties of drought and water Scarcity">MaRIUS</abbr> critical thresholds of drought characteristics that trigger changes in long term farm-level planning were established. Farm modelling tools were used to simulate agricultural impacts and farmer responses, and analyse the impacts and trade-offs of different irrigation management strategies and decisions.

The maps right show potential changes in different land use types (Intensive Farmland/Arable, Grassland, Very Extensive Grassland, Forest, Urban, Unmanaged) under scenarios of increasing temperatures and declining precipitation.
