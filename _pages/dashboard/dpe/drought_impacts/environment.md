Climate change is already affecting habitats and their species in several ways and future changes in temperature and water availability are likely to lead to further changes in the distribution of many species and thus in habitat composition and functioning. Both water scarcity and drought could also result in changes to the ecosystem services provided by the ecosystems and their species. In <abbr title="Managing the Risks, Impacts and Uncertainties of drought and water Scarcity">MaRIUS</abbr> we focused on selected **woodland**, **river**, **wetland** and **grassland** ecosystems, concluding that all ecosystems will respond to drought, but will vary in the magnitude of the impact and their ability to recover.

For example, **woodlands** are very important for biodiversity, carbon storage, water regulation and watershed protection. Recent literature has reported drought-induced mortality and dieback of forests in different regions across the world. In Great Britain, the potential impacts of drought on tree species and woodlands are not well understood. In Marius, therefore, we have analysed the temporal and spatial patterns of the potential impacts of and vulnerability to drought for important British forest species. Results highlighted that:

- Droughts can alter the processes that govern terrestrial ecosystems, leading to changes in their species composition, structure and functioning, their interactions and benefits they provide to people. 
- Ecosystems in the south and east of England and Wales are more likely to be altered by climate change than those elsewhere in Great Britain.
- In woodlands, beech and oak appear to be more susceptible to drought than other tree species.

The map right highlights the percentage change in tree mortality of beech and oak across sub-catchments in the Thames Basin, in the near (2030s) and far future (2080s) relative to the baseline.
