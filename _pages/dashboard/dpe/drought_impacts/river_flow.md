The Environment Agency and water companies monitor droughts using various indicators or drought triggers. Triggers can be based on hydrological thresholds such as river levels and flows, reservoir storage and groundwater levels. Understanding the hydrological response to rainfall deficit is essential for drought risk assessment, management and water resource planning.

Hydrological models represent the land surface, rivers, vegetation and sub-surface water. In particular, they are used to estimate river flows and soil moisture for ecological and agricultural impacts assessment, as well as providing the basis for a water quality assessment.

Output from the hydrological models can be used within [ecology]({{ site.dpe_url }}/drought_impacts/ecology/), [water resource management]({{ site.dpe_url }}/drought_management/water_supply_options/), [farming]({{ site.dpe_url }}/drought_impacts/farming/), and [economic]({{ site.dpe_url }}/drought_impacts/economy/) modelling for further analysis of impacts of drought and water scarcity.
