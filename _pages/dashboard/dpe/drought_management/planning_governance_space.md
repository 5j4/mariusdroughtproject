The current legal regime in the UK involves a range of statutory provisions, regulations as well as non-binding soft law, which provide significant discretion for key actors to decide which [demand](https://5j4.github.io/mariusdroughtproject.org/dashboard/dpe/drought_management/managing_demand/) and [supply](https://5j4.github.io/mariusdroughtproject.org/dashboard/dpe/drought_management/water_supply_options/) options are chosen to manage the impact of water scarcity. How key decision-makers exercise this discretion depends also on what evidence is available about drought impacts and options.

The below figure maps the drought planning framework in England. The key actors in the governance space for drought planning in England are Defra, Ofwat, the EA, water companies, customer-citizens, and consultants. Other actors include Natural England (NE), the Consumer Council for Water (CCW) the Drinking Water Inspectorate (DWI), and the European Union (EU).
