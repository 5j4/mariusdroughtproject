It is anticipated that population growth and increased demand for water from households and industry will place more strain on the water supply system in the future, particularly when coupled with the projected effects of [climate change](https://5j4.github.io/mariusdroughtproject.org/dashboard/dpe/drought_events_past_future/) on drought characteristics.

As such options to manage demand can be as crucial as options to manage or increase supply.

Managing demand is as important as increasing supply. There are number of measures water
companies us to help manage demand:
• reinforcing existing water efficiency activities with new campaigns and improving
communications with customers
• reducing leakage below target levels
• targeting domestic metering in areas of water stress as a long term plan
• managing water pressure in the supply system in drought affected areas
• working with business customers to help reduce their demand
• introducing temporary use bans (see 3.1.1.)
