It is anticipated that population growth and increased demand for water from households and industry will place more strain on the water supply system in the future, particularly when coupled with the projected effects of [climate change](https://5j4.github.io/mariusdroughtproject.org/dashboard/dpe/drought_events_past_future/) on drought characteristics.

As such options to manage demand can be as crucial as options to manage or increase supply.

The Environment Agency have highlighed a number of measures water companies can implement to help manage demand, with such options explored and reviewed as part of MaRIUS. For example:

- water efficiency information and initiatives
- active leakage control
- water metering
- and regulatory options such as non-essential use restirctions and temporary use bans
