Droughts and water scarcity jointly pose a substantial threat to the environment, agriculture, infrastructure, society and culture in the UK, yet our ability to characterise and predict their occurrence, duration and intensity, as well as minimise their impacts, is often inadequate.

In MaRIUS we developed new methodologies and models for analysis of the impacts of water scarcity on ecosystems, society and various economic activities including agriculture, industry and household consumers. By supporting the analysis of a full range of impacts in a common framework MaRIUS provides multi-attribute characterisation of drought impacts and evidence to evaluate trade-offs between different impacts.

Droughts and water scarcity affect rain-fed and irrigated **agricultural systems** across multiple timescales.  Effects on long term yield and profit variability influence farm business planning and investment, for example affecting crop and rotation selection and investment in infrastructure for irrigation. In MaRIUS critical thresholds of drought characteristics that trigger changes in long term farm-level planning were established. Farm modelling tools were used to simulate agricultural impacts and farmer responses, and analyse the impacts and trade-offs of different irrigation management strategies and decisions.
