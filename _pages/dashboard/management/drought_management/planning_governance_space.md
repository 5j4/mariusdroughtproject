_title: Drought planning governance space
---

The current legal regime in the UK involves a range of statutory provisions, regulations as well as non-binding soft law, which provide significant discretion for key actors to decide which demand and supply options are chosen to manage the impact of water scarcity. How key decision-makers exercise this discretion depends also on what evidence is available about drought impacts and options.

This figure maps the drought planning framework in England. The key actors in the governance space for drought planning in England are Defra, Ofwat, the EA, water companies, customer-citizens, and consultants. Other actors include Natural England (NE), the Consumer Council for Water (CCW) the Drinking Water Inspectorate (DWI), and the European Union (EU). 

*The full details of each key actor above will be in the science pages – would like to make the actors names (e.g. ‘water company’) in the figure clickable so some text can come up for each if possible?*

*Add summary of key findings and link to Drought Primer when available.*
