Droughts will continue to occur in the future and it is very likely that water scarcity and the risk this poses to the economy, society, and environment will increase due to climate change, and increasing pressure on water supplies from population growth and environmental management obligations.

Results from MaRIUS have highlighted that the *frequency and intensity of droughts experienced in the past is likely to change e.g. a drought with similar intensity to 2010-2012 may occur x times more frequently in the future…drought intensity likely to increase by x%.... [Link to Droughts event page]. The consequences of this on hydrological variables included…[Link to Hydrological response page].*

This has large implications in terms of overall drought risk. Furthermore, changing patterns of demand, land use, practices and socio-economic conditions can all affect future risk… [page links]…

The models and methods developed and analysis of MaRIUS are key to understanding such risks and uncertainty, and support the transition to more risk based drought management. A risk-based approach will enable the development of management measures whose costs and impacts are in proportion to the probability and consequences of water scarcity, informed by a mature understanding of droughts from the perspectives of a range of communities and stakeholders.

*For example, outputs from MaRIUS could be integrated by, and support, water companies development of long-term water resource plans and adequate resources… other users can take account of outputs e.g…*

*Highlight future challenges for specific sectors/users and how they could use insights from MaRIUS to plan/adapt. ‘So What?’ statements and policy relevance/impact….*
