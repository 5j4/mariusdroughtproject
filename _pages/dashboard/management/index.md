_title: Management Dashboard
---
The **management dashboard** provides a summary of environmental, economic and social dimensions of drought and water scarcity. It provides a common platform for the exploration of the multiple impacts, the effectiveness of management options, and potential trade-offs at different geographical and spatial scales.

The dashboard is designed to be non-technical (with technical aspects available via the [**science dashboard**](https://5j4.github.io/mariusdroughtproject.org/dashboard/science/)), to enable the user to readily understand, visualise, explore, and compare likely outcomes arising from applying pre-existing drought management arrangements and/or enhanced or innovative management strategies. 

Graphics are interactive to allow different results for a comparable set of drought events to be visualised. These are synthesised on the interactive drought impact and management page where different combinations of management options can be explored to see how they could affect a wide range of impacts and overall risk.
