_title: Management Dashboard
---
The **management dashboard** provides a summary of environmental, economic and social dimensions of drought and water scarcity. It provides a common platform for the exploration of the multiple impacts, the effectiveness of management options, and potential trade-offs at different geographical and spatial scales.

The dashboard is designed to be non-technical (with technical aspects available via the science dashboard), to enable the user to readily understand, visualise, explore, and compare likely outcomes arising from applying pre-existing drought management arrangements and/or enhanced or innovative management strategies. The pages provide key results and examples of how these could be used to support drought management.

The pages outline the different components of the MaRIUS research and are structured to provide an end-to-end overview of drought and water scarcity, impacts, and management options. The graphics on each page are interactive to allow users to visualise different results for a comparable set of drought events. 

These results are synthesised in the interactive drought impact and management page. This allows the user to select different combinations of options and outputs, visulising how these could affect a wide range of impacts and overall risk.
