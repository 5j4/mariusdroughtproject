## Key science findings or outputs

* Dataset: A retrospective of the weather during past droughts for 1851-2014 using the regional climate model HadRM3P driven by the 20CR reanalysis.
* Dataset: Weather time series for synthetic droughts using weather@home2, consisting of 100s drought events for 1900-2006, 2020-2050 and 2070-2100.
* An analysis of the expected changes in meteorological droughts in the future.
* An analysis of the drivers of meteorological droughts (e.g., sea surface temperature patterns).
 
## Introduction

Weather is the primary driver or trigger of droughts, via precipitation deficits and/or excessive evapotranspiration, that can lead to a drying at the land surface. However, the limited number of droughts in the observational record hampers accurate quantification of the probabilities associated with various types of droughts. In MaRIUS, a large number of drought events are generated with a climate model for present and future conditions, which are then fed into various hydrological and impact models to allow for a more accurate quantification of drought risk. In addition, this dataset is used to investigate the large-scale drivers of drought, such as sea surface temperatures.

## Research methods

The datasets are generated using the regional climate model HadRM3P, run at a resolution of 25km over Europe. On the one hand, a past retrospective is constructed by prescribing the circulation and other atmospheric variables from a reanalysis product (20CR reanalysis), to drive HadRM3P and so to provide a continuous dataset covering 1851-2014. On the other hand, a global climate model, (HadAM3P, the parent global model of HadRMP), driven by observed sea surface temperature is used to drive HadRM3P (using the weather@home2 distributed climate modelling system), thereby generating a large number of droughts that could have occurred in the past. The same system is then used with sea-surface temperatures increased consistent with a range of future projections to generate a large number of droughts that could occur in the future. Daily model output on the 25km model grid includes relevant variables such as precipitation, temperature, and variables needed to estimate potential evaporation. Drought are then identified from the time series, to be used as input to impact models.

Comparing the simulated future and recent past synthetic drought event sets will provide an estimate how drought risk might change in the future.

Comparing the probabilities of drought on different years with different sea surface temperature patterns will allow us to identify the oceanic controls on UK droughts.
