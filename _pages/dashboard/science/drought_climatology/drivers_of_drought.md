## Introduction

The large number of drought events generated for the 20th century (Hindcast and synthetic baseline event set) are expected to be useful to assess the role of various oceanic, atmospheric and local drivers to droughts. For instance, sea surface temperature and sea ice, the North Atlantic Oscillation, or atmospheric blockings may be investigated.
