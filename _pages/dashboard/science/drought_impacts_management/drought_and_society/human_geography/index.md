The human geography research in the MaRIUS project (Tasks A1 and C4) has drawn on a range of qualitative methods to explore drought knowledges generated by different means and deployed by different actors in society. Drawing on science and technology studies perspectives we have mapped drought science, expertise and knowledge in relation to water resources and river management on different geographical scales. Developing transdisciplinary participatory methods we have also brought scientific knowledge and tools in contact with experience-based local knowledge with an Environmental Competency Group (ECG) and Community Modelling (CM).
