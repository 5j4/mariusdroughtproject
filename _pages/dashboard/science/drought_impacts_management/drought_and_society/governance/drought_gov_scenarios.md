## Key science findings

* A scenario building workshop develops explorative scenarios for drought management and offers the opportunity for unconstrained blue sky thinking about drought management options based on the question, *What can happen?*
 
## Introduction

One element of the <abbr title="Managing the Risks, Impacts and Uncertainties of drought and water Scarcity">MaRIUS</abbr> project is to explore and review options for drought management practice in England & Wales beyond the existing regulatory framework and to discuss qualitatively the potential effectiveness of and constraints upon these options with stakeholders. Therefore, a scenario building workshop is organised and offers:

* the possibility to develop explorative scenarios for drought management
* the opportunity for unconstrained blue sky thinking about drought management options based on the question *What can happen*?
to be useful in cases where there is fairly good knowledge regarding how the system works at present, but one is interested in exploring the consequences of alternative developments in drought management
* The scenario building workshop is an interactive workshop bringing together different stakeholders’ and researchers’ perspectives on drought management.

## Research methods

**Explorative Scenario Building Workshop**

The workshop has an interactive format and requires active participation from every participant and involves small group discussions as well as plenary discussions. Methodologically the workshop follows the following outline:

* introduction and definition of problem frame, e.g.: resilient drought management in England & Wales
* identification and grouping of “drivers” for future management of drought (e.g.: population growth)
* selection of relevant drivers for scenario development
* scenario description based on critical drivers
* ßscenario story lines (first ideas)
