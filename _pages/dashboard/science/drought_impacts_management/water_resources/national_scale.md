## Key science outputs: 
1.	National model : Water resource system of  water companies in England 

## Introduction 

In a project with Atkins for Water UK (Water UK, 2016), a national water resource model is developed which covers main water companies in England with the potential transfer schemes between them. Simplified version of Thames Water, United Utilities, Yorkshire, Severn Trent and Anglian water companies were included in the model and the storage behaviour validated against water companiesâ€™ own model when historic data sets were run through WATHNET. 


## Results:  

The national model has 600 arcs and 380 nodes. The figure 1 presents a snapshot of the model. The computation time on a desktop computer (3.40 GHz) for 30 years of simulation on daily basis is 9 minutes.
