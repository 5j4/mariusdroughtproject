## Key science findings

Climate change with its associated water scarcity could lead to changes in wetland communities, as species no longer have suitable climate space.
For MG4 lowland meadows, many of the key species are projected to lose suitable climate space in southern, eastern and central England and Wales, by the 2050s under a medium emission scenario (Fig 1) Suitable climate space for MG4 Alopecurus pratensis–Sanguisorba officinalis Lowland hay meadows under a UKCP09 High emissions 50% probability scenario for the 2050s

## Introduction 

Climate change is already affecting habitats and their species in several ways. Future changes in temperature and water availability are likely to lead to changes in the distribution of many species and thus in habitat composition. We focused on selected wetland, grassland and woodland habitats. While these changes are seen at different scales, ecological responses to climate are currently best modelled at the national to regional or catchment scale. Droughts also will have an effect on the functioning and distribution of species. Both water scarcity and drought could also result in changes to the ecosystem services provided by the habitats and their species. 

## Research methods

Using databases of species’ distribution or published maps, which we digitised, we applied an ensemble of species distribution models (BIOMOD) and also an artificial neural network model (SPECIES) to characterise the relationship between each distribution and baseline climate. We then applied the UKCP09 and the <abbr title="Managing the Risks, Impacts and Uncertainties of drought and water Scarcity">MaRIUS</abbr> future events dataset to these relationships in order to project how the suitable climate space for the growth of that species might change.  The potential impacts on the habitats were inferred by examining the changes in suitable climate space for its dominant and characteristic species.

### MG 4 Alopecurus pratensis–Sanguisorba officinalis Lowland hay meadows

Changes in suitable climate space for MG 4 Alopecurus pratensis–Sanguisorba officinalis Lowland hay meadows species under different UKCP09 scenarios. Low and High refer to the emissions scenario. SCP1 and 9 to the 10% and 90% probability respectively.
This grassland type is currently found almost entirely within England, with only a few sites in the east of Wales.  The species that characterise it are projected to progressively lose suitable climate space in southern, eastern and central England and in Wales (Fig 2). The only exception is bird’s-foot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus). This suggests that in the southern half of England there could be large changes in the composition of this habitat.

There are important concentrations of lowland meadows in the Thames Basin, but by the 2050s some of it is likely to become climatically unsuitable for these species. Under a high emissions scenario, all suitable climate space for most of them is project to be lost by the 2050s, leading to a potential loss of this habitat which is important for conservation.
