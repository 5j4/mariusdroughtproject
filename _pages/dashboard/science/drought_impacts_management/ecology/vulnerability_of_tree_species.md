## Key science findings

* Indicated by simulated tree mortality, north England, west Wales and southwest Scotland are likely to be more vulnerable to historical droughts.
* The upward trend of tree mortality to climate is relatively more significant in lowland England, west Scotland and Wales.
* The most vulnerable areas of beech include west Scotland, northwest England and Wales, and those of oak and ash include west Scotland, northeast England and southwest Wales.
* There is no significant upward mortality trend for beech across Great Britain, whereas the upward trend of ash and oak is significant in west Scotland and southeast England.

## Introduction 

Forest is the most important ecosystem for carbon storage, watershed protection and biodiversity. Recent literature has reported drought-induced mortality and dieback of forests in different regions across the world. In the UK, the mean summer temperature is projected to rise by 3°C to 4°C in 2080s due to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, however, the potential impacts on tree species and forests are not well understood. There is thus a need to assess the vulnerability of the UK’s tree species to drought in order to provide scientific evidence to aid effective forest management and habitat conservation in adaption to climate change. Marius has analysed the vulnerability of important British forest species and their mortality trend.

## Research methods

We applied a version of the LPJ-GUESS (process-based dynamic vegetation-terrestrial ecosystem) model parameterized with 18 European tree species and/or plant functional types to simulate vegetation dynamics across Great Britain and over the period from 1929 to 2011. The tree mortality in LPJ-GUESS, is defined as the 5-year average of annually net primary productivity (NPP) divided by leaf area index (LAI), and indicates the tree growth influenced by water stress.  A vulnerability index was developed as summation of the simulated tree mortality above a specified threshold (i.e. the long term average of simulated mortality). The pre-whiting Mann-Kendall test was used to investigate the significant trend of tree mortality based on historical simulation. The spatial variability of vulnerability and significant trend of tree mortality for selected British species (i.e. beech, oak and ash) was interpreted.
