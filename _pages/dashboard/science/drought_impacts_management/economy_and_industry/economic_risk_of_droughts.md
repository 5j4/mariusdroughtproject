## Key science findings

* Direct, indirect and total output losses caused by different severity droughts and different water policy management options
* Impact on electricity generation
* Highlight economically most vulnerable communities and sectors

## Introduction

Economic impacts of drought can be large and far-ranging. The quantification of the potential scale of economic losses during droughts is important to inform trade-offs between uses of water and to help decision makers understand the scale of economic risks and need for investment and regulatory action. The economic impacts of past droughts and more extreme simulated droughts on specific sectors is assessed, providing output measures such as: changes in relative input or production costs; and changes in relative final output or production levels. Analysis of the economic impacts of droughts has focused upon domestic and commercial water consumers and upon major industrial abstractors, notably electricity generation. This is important as in England and Wales, the electricity sector is responsible for 40% of non-tidal surface water abstractions. When sufficient cooling is not possible, power station operators are required to ‘ramp down’ the generation output in order to reduce cooling demand. The risk of this occurring is computed.

## Research methods

A new analytical framework was developed, to capture all the factors that contribute to, or mitigate against, the economic costs or impacts of a drought (including policy-making, planning and management actions). Using an Economic I-O model the direct and indirect losses of drought on domestic and commercial water consumers and major industrial abstractors, notably electricity generation are quantified. The approach combines empirical analysis based on evidence from past droughts, and extends to more extreme simulated droughts in order to construct a more complete picture of the full distribution of possible impacts and associated losses.
