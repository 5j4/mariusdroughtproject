## Key science findings or outputs

* Droughts cause reduction in low flows and therefore increase phosphorus concentration in the river due to decreased availability of water to dilute wastewater effluents.
* Climate change is expected to increase drought severity and phosphorus concentration in rivers, but the response of phytoplankton varies depending on the functional group.
 
## Introduction

River water quality is fundamental for ecosystems and water supply. Yet, the impacts of droughts on river water quality are poorly understood, due to lack of extensive data and the non-linear interactions between different natural and human-induced processes. The objective of this work package is to understand how droughts affect nutrients, sediment and phytoplankton in river systems, taking into account the further complexity added by climate change and anthropogenic pressures.

## Research methods 

In this task, the River Thames is used as a case-study, due to its importance as a freshwater supplier and effluent recipient and to its high conservation value. Hydrological and water quality models are developed to understand the system behaviours. These models are then used to explore the impact of climate variability and land-use change on river water quality. Different methodological approaches are used, such as coupling the water quality models with climate models, or exploring the sensitivity of the water quality models to the climatic input (scenario-neutral methodology).

## Droughts cause an increase phosphorus concentration in the river due to decreased availability of water to dilute wastewater effluents. 

Under current land-use and phosphorus removal mitigation strategies, average phosphorus concentrations range from 0.11 to 0.16 mg L-1, being inversely proportional to precipitation due to the dominance of sewage effluent inputs at this site (Bowes et al., 2015). When an increase in agricultural land use is applied, the average phosphorus concentration increases up to between 0.15 and 0.18 mg L-1. In this case, phosphorus concentration is still inversely proportional to rainfall, although for increases in precipitation greater than 20% this trend inverts and precipitation is directly proportional to phosphorus concentration. This suggests a shift from a point source-dominated to a diffuse source-dominated regime, due to the joint effect of increased rainfall and expansion of agricultural land. The average phosphorus concentration drops to 0.07-0.09 mg L-1 if a combined phosphorus removal strategy is implemented.

Change in the average phytoplankton abundance in the River Thames (UK) in reach 1 due to climate alteration (precipitation and temperature), under current conditions of land-use and current phosphorus removal mitigation strategies. In each plot, the x-axis represents the alteration in temperature (°C), the y-axis the alteration in precipitation (%), while the resulting change in average phytoplankton cell abundance is represented with colours. Each plot is associated with a different phytoplankton group (diatoms, chlorophytes, picoalgale, cyanobacteria and Microcystis-like cyanobacteria). The black dots represent the changes in precipitation and temperature of 10,000 UKCP09 change factors.

Change in the average phytoplankton abundance in the River Thames (UK) in reach 1 due to climate alteration (precipitation and temperature), under current conditions of land-use and current phosphorus removal mitigation strategies. In each plot, the x-axis represents the alteration in temperature (°C), the y-axis the alteration in precipitation (%), while the resulting change in average phytoplankton cell abundance is represented with colours. Each plot is associated with a different phytoplankton group (diatoms, chlorophytes, picoalgale, cyanobacteria and Microcystis-like cyanobacteria). The black dots represent the changes in precipitation and temperature of 10,000 UKCP09 change factors.

Precipitation, and hence flow, is the key control for Microcystis-like cyanobacteria and diatoms and large chlorophytes: i.e. phytoplankton concentration is much more sensitive to changes in precipitation than to changes in temperature. Temperature is the main control for cyanobacteria – although cyanobacteria are also sensitive, to a lesser extent, to changes in precipitation. Picoalgae appear to be driven by both precipitation and temperature. Similarly, Chlorophytes are driven by both climatic stressors, although for low values of temperature change, precipitation seems to prevail as the key control.

The sensitivity of phytoplankton to climate change is smaller for diatoms, chlorophytes and Microcystis-like cyanobacteria and higher for picoalgae and cyanobacteria. For example, while cyanobacteria can double their average concentration in reach 1 for an increase in temperature of +3°C, chlorophytes only show an increase between 5 and 10%.

Chlorophytes, diatoms and Microcystis-like cyanobacteria decrease their concentration along with precipitation, while cyanobacteria and picoalgae increase it.
