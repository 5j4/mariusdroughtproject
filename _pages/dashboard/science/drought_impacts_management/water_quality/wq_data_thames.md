Water quality data for River Thames at Swinford - **Chlorophyll** concentration

## Introduction 

Task B4 generated the weekly water quality and biological data from two sites on the River Thames and Farmoor reservoir.  These were the key data required to investigate how changes in nutrients and flow would affect phytoplankton ecology and the likelihood of algal blooms.

## Research methods

Samples were manually sampled at weekly intervals and analysed at the CEH Wallingford laboratories using standard protocols. 

Phytoplankton characterised by Flow Cytometry.
