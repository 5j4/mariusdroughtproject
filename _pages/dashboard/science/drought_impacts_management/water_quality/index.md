Water quality in rivers and reservoirs is seriously affected by drought. Low flows reduce dilution which raises nutrient concentrations, stimulating algal growth. Increased temperatures affect dissolved oxygen concentrations, again impacting ecology. Chemical kinetics also change in droughts affecting metals, organic and contaminants. Water resources can be impacted by water quality issues:
