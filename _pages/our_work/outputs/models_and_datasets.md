There will be numerous datasets and model developments arising from the <abbr title="Managing the Risks, Impacts and Uncertainties of drought and water Scarcity">MaRIUS</abbr> project, including:

#### Water Quality

* PROTECH Reservoir water quality and ecology (phytoplankton) model set up for Farmoor
* WQ variables of the River Thames and Farmoor reservoir
* INCA N and P models set up for the Thames catchment.
* Compilation of national-scale water quality dataset from the Harmonised Monitoring scheme (HMS) of key catchment and water quality determinand responses to specific drought periods from 1974 onwards.
* New algal model for rivers developed

#### Groundwater

Prof Jim Freer has compiled a groundwater level dataset for the Thames catchment

#### Climate

The Drought Event Sets will be made publically avialable when ready
