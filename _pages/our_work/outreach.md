The <abbr title="Managing the Risks, Impacts and Uncertainties of drought and water Scarcity">MaRIUS</abbr> project researchers want the project outputs to be as meaningful as possible to both the academic and user communities. In order for the project to realise its aims, and help move the UK towards a risk based approach to manage water resources with a particular regard for water scarcity, it is important that the project is known about widely, and the researchers to liaise with as many different types as of stakeholders as possible.

In order to maintain academic rigour, the project has the support of a team of international academic experts in drought and water scarcity research.

The project also benefits from the inputs of a number of experienced industry practitioners, who form the [Stakeholder Advisory Group]({{ site.baseurl}}/about_marius/people/stakeholders_and_partners/), and have committed to give their time to help guide the research and help bring their operational expertise to the research.

In addition to the specific Stakeholder Advisory Group, the project wishes to engage with as many interested parties in the subject of water management for drought, in order to understand the needs of as wide a group as possible. This wider group of contributors will be able to help the project by giving feedback and comments in open workshops and events on subjects such as what would be helpful to them when managing for the possibility of drought (information, datasets, methods) and also to test outputs such as the Dashboard, so that it is as suitable for the end-users needs as possible.

### Collaborations & Partnerships

* The project team have participated in a 2-day workshop with some of its International Advisory Board in September 2014, 2015 and 2016 to ensure the academic work is as rigorous and as excellent as can be. The International Advisory Board members present were: Christopher Duffy, Penn State University, USA; Greg Garfin, Arizona University, USA; Peter Wallbrink, CSIRO, Australia; and Lee Godden, Melbourne University, Australia.  Further to this, on a separate occasion, Dr Victoria Bell, and Dr Ali Rudd met with Dr Narendra Tuteja, Bureau of Meteorology, Australia, to discuss drought research and findings.

* Dr Eric Sarmiento and Dr Catharina Landstrom have met with and interviewed representatives of local groups to prepare for the environmental competency and community modelling group work in order to meet human geography research objectives.

* Dr Catharina Landstrom, Dr Eric Sarmiento and Prof. Sarah Whatmore created an Environmental Competency group with locals in the Kennet Catchment, Berkshire.  This is a key multidisciplinary approach to exploring knowledge and issues surrounding drought and water scarcity.  The researchers participating in the Environmental Competency group cover human geography, legislation/governance, water quality, and water resources modelling.

* Dr Catharina Landstrom, Dr Eric Sarmiento and Prof Sarah Whatmore created a Community Modelling approach with local groups in the River Lea catchment, London.  This group will examine community modelling approaches to engage local groups.

* Dr Thorsten Wagener and Dr Jude Musuuza, University of Bristol, have been working with Dr Duffy (Penn State University, USA) and his team to improve the PIHM model and its representation of low flows and groundwater resources to drought.

* Dr Thorsten Wagener and Dr Jude Musuuza, University of Bristol, have been working with Prof Stefan Kollet (University of Bonn, Germany) to perform a model inter-comparison study of the main integrated mechanistic hydrology models currently available, using the synthetic catchment (used in Maxwell et al., 2014 WRR (doi:10.1002/2013WR013725))

* Dr Jaume Freire, Dr Chris Decker and Prof. Jim Hall, University of Oxford, have made contact with University of Leiden, Netherlands, to access a critical database for research into the economic effect of drought.

* Dr Mohammad Mortazavi-Naeini, University of Oxford, has been working with staff from Thames Water to understand its distribution system in order to create a water simulation model that best simulates the Thames Catchment, for drought analyses.

* Prof Thorsten Wagener and Dr Gemma Coxon have been working as part of the Panta Rhei Working Group ‘Drought in the Anthropocene’.
