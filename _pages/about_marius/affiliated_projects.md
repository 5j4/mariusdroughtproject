<abbr title="Managing the Risks, Impacts and Uncertainties of drought and water Scarcity">MaRIUS</abbr> is part of NERCâ€™s [UK Droughts and Water Scarcity Programme](http://www.nerc.ac.uk/research/funded/programmes/droughts/){:target="_blank"}.

The Programme aims to deliver evidence to inform adaptation and management decisions before, during and after drought events, and in the context of increasing concerns about water security.  It has the following goals:

Characterise the drivers and nature of droughts and water scarcity.
Examine the multiple and inter-linked impacts of UK droughts and water scarcity on the environment, agriculture, infrastructure, society and culture and the trade-offs between them.
Develop methods to support decision making for drought and water scarcity planning and management.
 
4 projects were funded under the [UK Droughts &amp; Water Scarcity Programme](http://www.nerc.ac.uk/research/funded/programmes/droughts/){:target="_blank"}, including MaRIUS:

* **[Historic Droughts](http://historicdroughts.ceh.ac.uk/){:target="_blank"}**: Understanding past drought episodes to develop improved tools for the future
* **IMPETUS**: **IM**proving **P**r**E**dictions of Drought **T**o inform **US**er decisions
* **[DRY](http://dryproject.co.uk/){:target="_blank"}**: Drought risk and you

Another project that <abbr title="Managing the Risks, Impacts and Uncertainties of drought and water Scarcity">MaRIUS</abbr> will be building upon includes the [**I**nfrastructure **T**ransitions **R**esearch **C**onsortium (ITRC)](http://www.itrc.org.uk){:target="_blank"}, which is developing a new generation of infrastructure system simulation models and tools to inform the analysis, planning and design of National Infrastructure covering energy, transport, water, waste, and information and communication technologies.
