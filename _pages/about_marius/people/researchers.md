The <abbr title="Managing the Risks, Impacts and Uncertainties of drought and water Scarcity">MaRIUS</abbr> research consortium incorporate expertise across the range of drought impacts from environmental, social, humanities, economics and engineering perspectives. Moreover, the consortium has a track record of innovation in the development of interdisciplinary science and stakeholder engagement. The consortium partners (Oxford, Bristol and Cranfield Universities, the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology and the Met Office) have worked together in a variety of collaborations, and are motivated by the prospect of developing an interdisciplinary and integrative approach to drought impacts analysis and risk management, which we consider to be very timely, both scientifically and in practice.

		<p>Dr Mohammad Mortazavi is a post-doctoral researcher at the University of Oxford. Mohammad’s research is focused on applying optimization methods in water resources management. His main interest is to address uncertainty and deep uncertainty associated with climate change and demand growth factors in water resources planning, especially during low-flow events and droughts. Developing drought management plans and also risk-based analysis of water planning are other research interests. For MaRIUS, his work involves developing water system models for the Thames basin and on a national scale. The long-term goals are to assess vulnerability of different users to drought events either in a catchment or on a national scale. The next step is to implement multi-objective optimization to sort through all possible solutions and their combinations for drought mitigation and to present trade-offs between desired objectives.Before arriving at Oxford, he worked at Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO), Australia, as a post-doc fellow. His research aim was to use real options analysis to address planning uncertainty in the commodity sector. He also applied multi-objective optimization to address climate change uncertainty in urban water planning in a research project at university of Newcastle, Australia, granted by National Climate Change Adaptation Research Facility (NCCARF) in Australia. Mohammad earned his PhD at the University of Newcastle, Australia and his Master’s Degree at Kh.N.Toosi university of Technology in Iran.

		<p>Dr Ponnambalam Rameshwaran is a Research Scientist at the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology in Wallingford. Ramesh’s research work focuses on river hydraulics, hydraulic and hydrological modelling and agro-hydrology including flood conveyance, flow behaviour through and around aquatic vegetation, sediment transport behaviour, turbulence measurements and modelling, flood and drought impact, aquatic weed management, river restoration, eco-hydraulics, fluvial ecosystems and physical habitat modelling and brackish water irrigation. His specialist knowledge and experience enable him to develop and apply more practical and refined two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) numerical models based on mathematical equations for the most complex turbulent flow problems in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
