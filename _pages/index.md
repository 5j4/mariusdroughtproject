_title: About MaRIUS
---
Droughts are one of the headline strategic risks to the UK. In 2012 the UK experienced the driest spring in over a century, after two dry winters. Ministers faced the prospect of water shortages during the London Olympics. Whilst the drought conditions in early 2012 served as a wake-up call, the potential for water shortages in the UK, driven by changing patterns of demand and changing climatic conditions, had already been recognised. In the Thames Water region alone it is estimated that severe water rationing could potentially result in economic losses of £300million/day. The capacity for the natural environment to recover from periods of very low flows, deteriorated water quality, dry soils and hot temperatures is not well understood.

Following this experience, the MaRIUS project has received NERC funding to explore how best to manage future droughts.  This project – Managing the Risks, Impacts and Uncertainties of drought and water Scarcity (MaRIUS) will introduce a risk-based approach to drought and water scarcity in order to inform management decisions and prepare households.

The project is designed to capture the complexity of the water scarcity by using expertise across the social and natural sciences and with key stakeholder involvement.

MaRIUS will use scenario modelling and case studies across a number of scales, from household to national, in order to understand both the drought impacts at a local level right as well as the institutional decision making by governments and water companies. The modelling will enable testing of drought scenarios and a thorough representation of their impacts on water quality, agriculture, biodiversity and economic losses.

In addition to the modelling component, social science and stakeholder engagement are a key part of the project and will help us to understand the role of institutions, regulation and the markets in drought management.

The Project Team is led by [Professor Jim Hall](http://www.eci.ox.ac.uk/people/jhall.html){:target="_blank"}, and comprises leading experts from a number of research institutions, including the [University of Oxford](http://www.ox.ac.uk){:target="_blank"}, [University of Bristol](http://www.bris.ac.uk){:target="_blank"}, [Cranfield University](http://www.cranfield.ac.uk){:target="_blank"}, the [Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (CEH)](http://www.ceh.ox.ac.uk){:target="_blank"}, and the [UK Meteorological Office](http://www.metoffice.gov.uk){:target="_blank"}.

Funding comes from [NERC](http://www.nerc.gov.uk){:target="_blank"} (ref: [NE/L010364/1](http://gotw.nerc.ac.uk/list_split.asp?awardref=NE%2FL010364%2F1){:target="_blank"}), in collaboration with [ESRC](http://www.esrc.ac.uk){:target="_blank"}, [EPSRC](https://www.epsrc.ac.uk){:target="_blank"}, [BBSRC](http://www.bbsrc.ac.uk){:target="_blank"} and [AHRC](http://www.ahrc.ac.uk){:target="_blank"}.

The project is funded for three years, from April 2014 to end of March 2017.
