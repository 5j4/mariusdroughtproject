      <p>The MaRIUS project benefits from expert advice and support from a very experienced group of UK based project partners in government, industry and NGOs. These partners form the project’s Stakeholder Advisory Group (SAG) and give inputs, in terms of time and expertise, to help steer the project. Liaison between the stakeholders and the project’s social and natural scientists will help to ensure that the outputs from the MaRIUS project, including the ‘impacts dashboard’, are matched to their needs and to the evolving policy context.</p>

<p>In addition we have close working relationships with Defra, Environment Agency, Ofwat, UKWIR and the Adaptation Sub-Committee of the Committee on Climate Change.</p>
