          <p>The <abbr title="Managing the Risks, Impacts and Uncertainties of drought and water Scarcity">MaRIUS</abbr> project researchers want the project outputs to be as meaningful as possible to both the academic and user communities. In order for the project to realise its aims, and help move the UK towards a risk based approach to manage water resources with a particular regard for water scarcity, it is important that the project is known about widely, and the researchers to liaise with as many different types as of stakeholders as possible.</p>

<p>In order to maintain academic rigour, the project has the support of a team of international academic experts in drought and water scarcity research.</p>

<p>The project also benefits from the inputs of a number of experienced industry practitioners, who form the <a href="/mariusdroughtproject.org/about_marius/people/stakeholders_and_partners/">Stakeholder Advisory Group</a>, and have committed to give their time to help guide the research and help bring their operational expertise to the research.</p>

<p>In addition to the specific Stakeholder Advisory Group, the project wishes to engage with as many interested parties in the subject of water management for drought, in order to understand the needs of as wide a group as possible. This wider group of contributors will be able to help the project by giving feedback and comments in open workshops and events on subjects such as what would be helpful to them when managing for the possibility of drought (information, datasets, methods) and also to test outputs such as the Dashboard, so that it is as suitable for the end-users needs as possible.</p>
