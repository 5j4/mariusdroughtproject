Developing drought management plans and also risk-based analysis of water planning are other research interests. For MaRIUS, his work involves developing water system models for the Thames basin and on a national scale. The long-term goals are to assess vulnerability of different users to drought events either in a catchment or on a national scale. The next step is to implement multi-objective optimization to sort through all possible solutions and their combinations for drought mitigation and to present trade-offs between desired objectives.Before arriving at Oxford, he worked at Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO), Australia, as a post-doc fellow. His research aim was to use real options analysis to address planning uncertainty in the commodity sector.

He is an internationally recognized expert in hydrologic modelling and in the development and use of systems approaches in environmental modelling, diagnostic evaluation of environmental models, predictions in ungauged basins (PUB) and integrated assessment of climate change impacts. Thorsten will be leading the work to use the Penn State Integrated Hydrologic Model (PIHM) for a physically based modelling approach to low flow modelling, at a range of different scales. Thorsten will also work with Jim Hall on the water system modelling aspects of the project."}

He provided detailed review of causes and effects of major drought in northern New Zealand in 2010-11, and developed and applied a practical river flow forecasting system to support drought management by regional government during the event. He developed a national hydrological model of New Zealand, and applied it to developing New Zealand’s first set of national water accounts. For MaRIUS, Ross will be working on the development and analysis of both catchment and national scale hydrological models."}

His research interests focus on hydrological modelling and water resource management, flood risk assessment, landslide susceptibility mapping, GIS and spatial data analytics. Jianjun’s main task within MaRIUS is to evaluate the ecohydrological and niche modelling options for drought risk assessment, particularly for river and wetland ecosystems; to implement innovative modelling solutions for analysis of the drought risk. This work will be undertaken with Pam Berry and Mike Acreman."}
