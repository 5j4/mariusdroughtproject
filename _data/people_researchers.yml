For MaRIUS, his work involves developing water system models for the Thames basin and on a national scale. The long-term goals are to assess vulnerability of different users to drought events either in a catchment or on a national scale. The next step is to implement multi-objective optimization to sort through all possible solutions and their combinations for drought mitigation and to present trade-offs between desired objectives.Before arriving at Oxford, he worked at Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO), Australia, as a post-doc fellow. His research aim was to use real options analysis to address planning uncertainty in the commodity sector.
